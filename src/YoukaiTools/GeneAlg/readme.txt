The class Gene should be inherited for the class that represents the gene object in the
GA. You need to define the fitness function, the text out functions, etc

Then you create an instance of the GA you wish to use (which is derived from BaseGA), and
to that you will pass the gene object.

Note that GA objects should always inherit the BaseGA object.
